Introduction
============

Observatories send their data to INTERMAGNET via two different
routes. For preliminary data products (all types of
non-definitive data including quasi-definitive), each
observatory is assigned to a Geomagnetic Information Node
(GIN). Observatories send their preliminary data to their
assigned GIN in ‘near real-time’, i.e. as soon as possible
after recording. The process is designed to be automated, so
that observatories can upload data to INTERMAGNET as part of
their automatic data recording or processing systems. Multiple
transmissions of preliminary data are possible, where an
observatory is refining the quality of the data shortly after
recording. The GIN is responsible for forwarding this data to
the INTERMAGNET web site for onward distribution to users. The
INTERMAGNET web site is the only place where users have access
to data from INTERMAGNET observatories. Observatories send
their definitive data to the ftp site of the Paris GIN. This
process is expected to be manual and only done once a year
(unless there are problems with the data that require
resubmission).

Data Format
-----------

A number of data formats are in use in INTERMAGNET. In some
cases this diversity exists to support handling of different
types of data, in other cases a new format has superseded (or
partially superseded) an older one.

Data Types
----------

Geomagnetic data is refined over time as the various sources
from which it is composed are recorded, combined and verified.
Data type in this context describes the state that a set of
data values have reached in the process of being published,
from raw data which is read directly from one or more sensors
to definitive data which is the final product of an observatory
to which no further changes are expected. The data formats used
with time-series geomagnetic data include (or imply) a data
type field in their metadata. This data type field is explained
below.

Where software is used to convert between formats (e.g. at GINs):

- The Reported data type is assumed to be interchangeable with
  the Variation data type.
- The Adjusted data type is assumed to be interchangeable with
  the Provisional data type.

The use of data types to describe more than the state of data
in the publication process is prone to error. INTERMAGNET is
moving to a system of describing the standard that a data set
meets and including this description alongside the data to
which it applies.

Geomagnetic Components (or Elements)
------------------------------------
Geomagnetic data can be described in a number of different
orientations. Component codes are used to describe the
individual elements of the geomagnetic vector.

-  X = H*cos(D)
-  Y = H*sin(D)
-  Z = F*sin(I)
-  H = F*cos(I)
-  H = SQRT(X^2 + Y^2)
-  F = SQRT(X^2 + Y^2 + Z^2)
-  tan(D) = Y/X
-  tan(I) = Z/H

Near Real-Time Preliminary Data
-------------------------------

INTERMAGNET wishes to make data available to users as soon as
possible after it is recorded. Observatories who are members of
INTERMAGNET are required to submit their preliminary data
within 72 hours of recording. This requirement has been in
place since INTERMAGNET was created and was a challenging
target in the days before the INTERNET. It is now a minimum
requirement. INTERMAGNET wishes to improve its near real-time
performance and has set these goals for near real-time performance:

-  1-second data: Available to users within 30 seconds.
-  1-minute data: Available to users within 2 minutes.

These are challenging targets and at present (2018) the
INTERMAGNET infrastructure is not able to support these
targets; the best possible performance is around 15-20 minutes.
However observatories are encouraged to submit preliminary data
to their assigned GIN as near to real-time as possible. The
best way to achieve this is using the web interface to submit
data in IAGA-2002 format.

.. _sub_dat_intro_gin:

Geomagnetic Information Nodes
-----------------------------

INTERMAGNET has a two stage approach to collection and
dissemination of non-definitive data. Observatories send their
data to one of 5 Geomagnetic Information Nodes (GINs). The GINs
then forward data to the INTERMAGNET web site for distribution
to users, where it is made available via a web service, a data
download application on the web and an FTP site. GINs may make
provision for observatories to access their own data once it
has been sent to the GIN, but there is no public access to data
at the GINs – all public access to data is via the INTERMAGNET
web site. Both GINs and the web site keep a permanent copy of
all data sent to them – no data is deleted (though it may be
overwritten if an observatory sends an update).

INTERMAGNET will not edit any data that an observatory has
sent, though it may contact an observatory if problems are
detected and may also remove spikes for the purposes of
plotting the data. GINs will send monthly reports of the
‘completeness’ of the data received from observatories. The
INTERMAGNET web site will send monthly reports to observatories
on the requests users have made for their data. The manager at
each GIN acts as a point of contact for IMOs to resolve any
data transmission and formatting problems.

depending on the observatories they handle and the services
they offer.
