Acknowledgment of Data from Observatories Participating in INTERMAGNET
----------------------------------------------------------------------


Publications making use of INTERMAGNET data should include an
acknowledgement statement of the form given below. The first
form is for cases where data from many observatories have been
used and it is not practical to list them all, or each of their
operating institutes. The second is for cases where research
results have been produced using a smaller set of observatories.

**Suggested Acknowledgement Text (template 1)**:

.. parsed-literal::

    The results presented in this paper rely on data collected at
    magnetic observatories. We thank the national institutes that
    support them and INTERMAGNET for promoting high standards of
    magnetic observatory practice.(|intermagnet_website|)

**Suggested Acknowledgement Text (template 2)**:

.. parsed-literal::

    The results presented in this paper rely on the data collected
    at <observatory name>. We thank <institute name>, for
    supporting its operation and INTERMAGNET for promoting high
    standards of magnetic observatory practice (|intermagnet_website|).
